shashank and Neha

We got connected through QuackQuack and really liked each other. We had so many things in common that we were perfectly made for each other. The only problem was we were from different states and her parents did not agree with our relationship. My parents convinced their family and finally they agreed. We are now leading a happy life. I thank QuackQuack for bringing Neha into my life as my life partner.
Ajay and Mrinalini

It's really exciting to tell that we found our true love on QuackQuack. We were matched based on our interests. Books were one of the common interests we share. I was truly inspired by the level of maturity Jyoti shows in tough situations. We share similar thoughts for life and our bonding grew with every text shared via QuackQuack. We had clear vision towards our future and QuackQuack played the role of cupid in bringing us together.
